Project Structure: DNA-Based Evolutionary Closeness Analysis

1️⃣ Data Collection
Use NCBI Entrez to fetch DNA sequences of two species.

Save sequences in FASTA format.

2️⃣ Sequence Processing
Read and parse sequences using Biopython’s SeqIO module.

Ensure sequences are properly formatted (remove gaps, unknown bases).

3️⃣ Sequence Alignment
Use Pairwise Alignment (Needleman-Wunsch or Smith-Waterman).

Alternatively, use BLAST to find homologous regions.

4️⃣ Similarity Calculation
Compute percent identity (how much of the sequences match).

Calculate evolutionary distance using substitution models.

5️⃣ (Optional) Phylogenetic Analysis
Construct a phylogenetic tree using ClustalW or Biopython’s Phylo module.

Visualize the tree to show evolutionary relationships.

6️⃣ Output & Interpretation
Display similarity percentage & relationship insights.

(Optional) Save results as a report or graphical tree.
