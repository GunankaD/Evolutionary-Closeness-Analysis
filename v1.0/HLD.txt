Project: DNA-Based Evolutionary Closeness Analysis üß¨üî¨
Here‚Äôs a high-level layout of your Biopython program:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Import Libraries

from Bio import Entrez, SeqIO, pairwise2, Phylo

Entrez: Fetch DNA sequences from NCBI.

SeqIO: Read and parse sequences.

pairwise2: Align sequences and compute similarity.

Phylo: Build and visualize phylogenetic trees.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch DNA Sequences from NCBI

def fetch_sequence(species_name):
    # Search NCBI for the species and fetch the sequence in FASTA format
    return sequence

3Ô∏è‚É£ Perform Sequence Alignment

def align_sequences(seq1, seq2):
    # Use Needleman-Wunsch or Smith-Waterman alignment
    return similarity_score


4Ô∏è‚É£ Compute Evolutionary Closeness

def compute_similarity(seq1, seq2):
    # Calculate percentage similarity based on alignment
    return similarity_percent


5Ô∏è‚É£ (Optional) Build a Phylogenetic Tree

def construct_phylogenetic_tree(sequences):
    # Generate tree and visualize relationships

6Ô∏è‚É£ Main Function to Run the Program

if __name__ == "__main__":
    species1 = "Homo sapiens"
    species2 = "Pan troglodytes"  # Example: Human vs. Chimpanzee

    seq1 = fetch_sequence(species1)
    seq2 = fetch_sequence(species2)

    similarity = compute_similarity(seq1, seq2)
    print(f"Similarity between {species1} and {species2}: {similarity}%")
This gives a modular structure‚Äîyou can build and test each part separately! üöÄ
